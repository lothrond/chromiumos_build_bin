 Manual Build
--------------

  00. Make sure you have ~/.googleapikeys populated correctly! (see README-APIKEYS).

  01. Share ~/bin with the chroot, (see README-SHARING):
       $ touch chromiumos/src/bin/.local_mounts
       $ echo "/home/$(whoami)/bin" > chromiumos/src/scripts/.local_mounts

      (The rest of this build assumes a shared folder in the chroot named ~/bin).

  02. Create chroot:
        $ cros_sdk

  03. Select your board (see README-BOARDS):
        (cr) $ export BOARD=cyan

      Select your disk image build (test/dev/base):
        (cr) $ export IMAGE=test

      Select verified boot mode (on/off):
        (cr) $ export VERITY=off

     OR

      Source build ENVIRONMENT for chroot:
        (cr) source ~/bin/environment/chroot.sh

      ** This repository defaults to building test images, without verified boot, for cyan boards.

      ** If you would like to build for another board, you will need to modify environment/chroot.sh 
         before running build_image.

  4. Build chromiumos:
       (cr) $ start_build

------
 Test
------

  0. Mount:
       (cr) $ mount_disk_image

  1. (Test)

  2. Unmount:
       (cr) $ unmount_disk_image

---------
 Install
---------

 00. Flash Chromium OS on to a usb stick.
       (cr) $ flash_image_usb

     **WARNING: this will of course format the usb stick**

 01. Make sure the Chrome OS device is in developer mode (see README-DEVMODE).

 02.
